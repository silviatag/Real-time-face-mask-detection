# Face-mask-detection
This is a real-time face mask detection program that uses Python and the Kaggle Face Mask Dataset to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The program uses computer vision techniques with the help of OpenCV and Keras libraries to detect the presence or absence of a mask in real-time.

# Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset
The Kaggle Face Mask Dataset used in this program contains images of people wearing and not wearing masks. The dataset is divided into two classes: with_mask and without_mask. The images are in JPG format and have varying sizes. The dataset is preprocessed and ready to be used for training and testing the mask detection model.

# Model:
The model used in this program is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained on the Kaggle Face Mask Dataset.

# Conclusion:
This real-time face mask detection program can be used in various applications that require the detection of mask-wearing in real-time, such as in public places, airports, and hospitals. The program is easy to use and can be modified to suit specific needs.
